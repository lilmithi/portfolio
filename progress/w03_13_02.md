### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was overwhelming because I had no prior experience with tools like jsplumb and rxjs so getting upto speed was quite draining :(
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more overhwelmed  because i have had to learn multiple libraries in a short while which is quite intensive.

- I find the project to be a bit challenging

- My level of stress is manageable
