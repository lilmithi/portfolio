### My lessons
<!-- What did I learn? -->
<u>Everything I learned</u>

- Basics of Angular
- Running an Angular project
- Serverless programming

<u>The key lesson(s) of this week:</u>

Observables are timelines. Values which change over time. Using Rxjs, a system can be developed to react to these timelines, hence the name "reactive programming."

### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was overwhelming as I had the pressure of learning a new framework (Angular).
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more encouraged because I have managed to learn a lot and can now create a basic application with the "few" :) skills i've learnt.

- I find the project to be exciting with each passing day as I get to collaborate and brainstorm on solutions to issues opened.

- My level of stress is manageable.
